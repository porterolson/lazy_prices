Lazy Prices Replication &amp; Extension Repo

`lazy_prices_fixing.ipynb` is my notebook for replicating _Lazy Prices_ using quintile sorts. 

`10k_get_alpha.ipynb` is my file to generate the alpha for my MVE backtest.

`gen_chart_table.ipynb` is my file to generate the tables and charts for my MVE backtest




Note I only have 10-K data whereas they have 10-K and 10-Q data.
